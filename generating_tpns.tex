\paragraph{}Now that we have supplied the relevant motivation and background for the task at hand, we can further define the problem which we wish to solve. 

\input{sections/generating_tpns_sections/formal_prob_def.tex}

\paragraph{}We are now ready to start getting our hands dirty and describe how we tackle this problem. 
\input{sections/generating_tpns_sections/methods.tex}


\paragraph{}First off, we describe our devised approach to Diverse Temporal Planning.
\input{sections/generating_tpns_sections/diverse_temporal_planning.tex}


\paragraph{}With a set of diverse TPSs $\{\pi_1 \ldots \pi_k\}$ at hand for our input planning task $\Pi$, we can dive in to tackling how to merge these into a single TPN representation, that compactly encodes all generated solutions and possibly more.
\input{sections/generating_tpns_sections/merging.tex}


\paragraph{} Once $\MergeSet$ has been acquired, we require a method to determine which merge operations to execute. The reason for this necessity is that the merge operations in $\MergeSet$ are only compatible by definition in the naive TPN.
\input{sections/generating_tpns_sections/merge_selection.tex}


\paragraph{} \centering This concludes our TPN generating process.\\
\centering we now showcase it's empirical results.\\
