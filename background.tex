\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

\paragraph{} We now review some of the necessary background for our work.
We start with a brief introduction to automated planning, one of the earliest areas of Artificial Intelligence, which addresses the problem of synthesizing autonomous behaviors in automated way from a model.

\paragraph{} In the circumstances of our work, as is in life, it is not enough to have a great plan, there is also a need for timing.  
\input{sections/background_sections/temporal_planning.tex}

\paragraph{} We now know how to obtain a single solution to our input temporal planning task. If we require a method for obtaining multiple different solutions.

\paragraph{} We are now ready to take a closer look at TPNs and their previous usages in the literature.

\paragraph{} To make sure our process provides Pike with high quality TPN, we will want some optimization formalism to use during the generation phase.
