\section{Problem Statement}
\label{intro: Problem Statement}

In this work, we describe the first method for the automatic generation of a TPN, given a specification of a temporal planning problem in standard PDDL 2.1 \cite{fox2003pddl2}. 
Furthermore, we explore different notions of the quality of TPN, and describe techniques for generating high quality TPNs.
