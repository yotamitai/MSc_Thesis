\section{Problem Statement}
\label{intro: Problem Statement}

In this work, we describe the first method for the automatic generation of a TPN, given a specification of a temporal planning problem in standard PDDL 2.1 \cite{fox2003pddl2}. 
Furthermore, we will attempt that the generated TPN be \emph{good}.

In this work we shall define a good TPN as being compact but flexible, we further elaborate on this subject in section \ref{generating: formal prob def}.
