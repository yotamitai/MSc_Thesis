\section{Thesis Roadmap}
\label{intro: Thesis Roadmap}

The structure of this Thesis is as follows.\\ \\
Chapter \ref{chap:background} covers the relevant background required for this work.\\ \\
Next, chapter \ref{chap: generating TPNS} provides an in depth description of our working process.\\ \\
Chapter \ref{chap: results} provides an empirical evaluation of our process on a set of IPC benchmarks and shows that our approach can quickly generate TPNs, even for large problems.\\ \\
Lastly, chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} summarizes the accomplishments of this Thesis and raises open questions for future work down this path.
